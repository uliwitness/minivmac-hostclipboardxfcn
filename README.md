# minivmac-hostclipboardxfcn

HyperCard XFCN for use with the Mini vMac emulator that lets you read and/or write the host computer's clipboard from inside the emulator.

## Syntax

Once you have built the XFCN using the included Think C 6 project as a code resource, you use it from inside HyperCard in one of two forms:

    put hostClipboard() into copiedText

Retrieves whatever is on the host clipboard right now and stores it in the variable `copiedText`.

    get hostClipboard("New text you want to copy.")

Copies the given string (in this example `New text you want to copy.`) to the host's clipboard, so you can paste it outside the emulator.
